\begin{enumerate}
    \item Describe, explain and justify the algorithm you use to create the representations. Explain how you generate the PSNR that is used to compare representations and make decisions. \\
    \myVbigbox{Place answer here}
    \item Show on a single R/D plot in Figure~\ref{rd}, the RD curves for each of your representations. Place appropriate legends and label your axes appropriately. Show on the plot your estimate for the crossover bitrates i.e. the maximum bitrate where the quality of representations at 138p and 274p are greater than 274p and 548p respectively.

\end{figure}
    \item Write here the quality and rate for your chosen representation at 138p.  \mybox{$\sim$ 900Kbps, 90dB}
    \item Write here the quality and rate for your chosen representation at 274p.  \mybox{$\sim$ 2048Kbps, 90dB}
    \item Write here the quality and rate for your chosen representation at 720p.  \mybox{$\sim$ 3MBps, 80dB}
    \item The $V_l$ representation at 274p has bitrate and PSNR = \mybox{ 0.1 Mbps, 8 dB}
    \item Comment on any differences between the  representation $V_l$ at 274p and your chosen representation. Comment on one useful alternative for large scale deployment. \\
       \mybbbbigbox{Did you choose the same representation? If so, why? If not, why not? Does your representation and the representation $V_l$ look the same? What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two alternatives? In the case of large scale deployment (e.g. Meta or YouTube) explain whether your algorithm would need to change.}
